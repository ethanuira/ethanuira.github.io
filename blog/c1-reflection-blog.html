            <h1>DBC</h1>

            <p>I'm not too sure on how to word my reviews, reflections, impressions and overall thoughts on this so
                this is most likely just gonna come out as a stream of thoughts so if it feels/seems disconjointed
                then I'm sorry. I'm also not the best at spelling in english so just keep that in mind too. I can 
                assure you that my code is much tidier ;)<br><br>
                
                With that out of the way lets begin with my thoughts on <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">
                Shereef's Fireside Chat</a>.<br>
                I feel like what Shereef describes the DBC course as a very
                student-friendly course. He makes sure to take time out to talk to all students and try and cover
                all bases while keeping the talk realistic and letting the students know that it may not be easy 
                for them, maybe someone might be ahead of you, maybe someone might be behind you, which I really
                appreciate. He also gives good adviced and tips that he uses to all the students. He uses good 
                analogies to translate what it feels like being in a DBC class. I feel the same kind of energy, 
                environment and working ethics from the EDA group and it comforts me a lot.<br><br>
                
                I enjoyed learning the roots of the idea of DBC and hearing why Shereef first taught someone coding 
                and how things have changed and evolved and how he's adapted the course around that and how he devoted
                everything towards the idea of DBC.<br><br>

                I'm personally excited to be a part of this community more so than the teachers have made me feel like
                I already am. I feel nervous just because I feel like when I get to a classroom with other students I
                may worry that I am underperforming compared to my peers.<br><br>
