                Something for the reader to note in this is that I only read three of the links so if you're looking for my 
                reaction on a certian one of the links you may not find it.<br><br>

                Now that thats been stated I'll start with what I thought on the
                <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-meditation-affects-your-brain">What is Meditation and How It Affects 
                Our Brains</a> blog by Belle Beth Cooper.<br>
                Meditation seems like a very interesting practice. Even though meditation is mostly about putting your focus 
                towards something it calms and relaxes both you and your brain. It can increase your life-span and also help
                with things like focus, creativity, anxiety and gray matter.I overall found this blog really interesting and 
                intend to try this practice at some point in the future as I have had anxiety attacks and from that - 
                struggle to focus on things now.<br><br>

                Next, I'll cover my thoughts on the
                <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/the-habits-of-successful-people-they-have-a-growth-mindset">The Habits 
                of Successful People: They Have a Growth Mindset</a> blog by James Clear.<br>
                This blog is about developing a "growth mindset". A "growth mindset" is knowing that you can improve yourself.
                Things like displaying that you can do things time and time again to yourself will build up your confidence.
                I find this idea interesting as I have never thought that I could always be confident instead of a "sometimes 
                you're confident, sometimes you're not" outlook. I will remember the words in this blog and think on it
                more. As for the practice itself - I don't that I will be able to actively put this idea into practice and I 
                will have to instead try and do it in a more natural sence for it to really work.<br><br>

                Following this I read about the <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro
                Technique</a> by Francesco Cirillo.<br>
                I liked this blog, maybe because it was simple to grasp, but the Pomodoro Technique is based around time 
                management. The idea is to set a task and do it in increments of 25 minutes. After each 25 minutes is up you
                take a quick break and then get back to work. I feel like this is a super easy concept that seems to work very
                effectively. I really want to test this technique.<br><br>
